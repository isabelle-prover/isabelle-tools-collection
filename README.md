# Isabelle Tools Collection
This is a collection of maintained [Isabelle](https://isabelle.in.tum.de) add-on tools.
Most are Isabelle/Scala components that are either very niche, too experimental,
or not stable enough, to have made it into the distribution.

Each tool resides in its own repository.
This page merely gives an overview,
and provides tooling to trigger ci pipelines on Isabelle changes.
All tools have a status badge indicating whether they work with the latest Isabelle development version.
